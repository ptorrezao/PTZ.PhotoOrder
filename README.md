I had the need to gather all the requests of photos to print (from a family event)

So the Flow of the application is,
- Drop the files into the folder (please resize it, for web use... We will not print from thoses)
- Change the AppSettings, with the Trello Settings

- The Family member goes through the site, put it on the basket and put their details on the form.
- A card is created on a Trello's Board,
- And the we can Follow the request, gather the money and make the order as a bulk.
